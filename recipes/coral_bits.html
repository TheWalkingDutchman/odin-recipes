    <p><strong>Coral Bits</strong> are one of the many undersea delicacies served at the Krusty Krab.</p>

    <p>Coral Bits are as simple as they sound: fresh coral shattered
        into bits is deep-fried at a temperature of 375<sup>o</sup> just long enough
        to obtain a golden-crisped crust and perfect crunch.
